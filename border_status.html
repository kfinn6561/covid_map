If so, contact your travel provider.</p> </div> <br> <br> <p>The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.</p> <p>The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory you’re travelling to.</p> <p>You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p> <h2 id="entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19">Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2> <h3 id="entry-to-georgia">Entry to Georgia</h3> <p>Foreign citizens from a limited number of countries, including the UK, are now allowed to enter Georgia by air under the following conditions:</p> <p>(1) Unrestricted entry for citizens of any country, including the UK, who have documentary proof of having received a full course of COVID vaccination.</p> <p>(2) Other UK citizens can enter Georgia dependent on submitting a travel history in advance and holding a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours.  You must take a further PCR test at your own expense on your third day in Georgia.</p> <p>(3) Of particular relevance to UK citizens - following discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in the UK, the Georgian Government announced that anyone entering Georgia who has been in the UK within the previous 14 days must undergo mandatory 12-day quarantine. This requirement applies to all nationalities and all entry or visa routes.  Full details are on the <a rel="external" href="https://mfa.gov.ge/MainNav/CoVID-19-sakitkhebi/sazgvris-kvetis-regulaciebi.aspx?lang=en-US">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.</p> <h3 id="entry-permits-and-extensions">Entry permits and extensions</h3> <p>For foreign citizens who were legally in Georgia before 14 March 2020, the Georgian Government has extended the period that their entry permits remain valid until 1 July 2021, provided the overstay was caused by one of the following circumstances, which must be documented:</p> <ul><li>if the person’s home country was a COVID high risk zone</li> <li>if there were border restrictions in the person’s home country</li> <li>if the person was in hospital or self-isolating for health reasons</li> <li>if the person could not leave Georgia due to cancelled flights.</li> </ul> <p>If you were legally in Georgia by 14 March and wish to renew your stay without applying for a residence card, you will need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.my.gov.ge/">book an appointment at Public Service Hall</a>. You should attend your appointment with a Georgian-speaker as you will need to make your renewal application and be interviewed in Georgian. Your application must include the reason why you could not renew your visa in time. The fee is 50 lari (approx. £13). Public Service Hall will review the case and make a decision within three days on whether, and if so, for how long to renew your visa.</p> <p>If during your visit to Georgia up to March 2020 you were driving using your UK driving license, and you have not been able to leave Georgia since due to Covid restrictions, you can continue to drive using the UK licence (provided it remains valid) for the remainder of your current visit to Georgia.</p> <p>If you are working or studying in Georgia and meet the requirements for a Georgian Residence Permit, you should apply for this through Public Service Hall. You should not remain on a visitor’s entry permit indefinitely.</p> <p>If you are in Georgia for more than 183 days and take up any form of paid employment, you are automatically liable for income tax and must inform the Revenue Service of your employment, whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. Non-compliance will be fined.</p> <h3 id="uk-passports">UK passports</h3> <p>In consideration of the difficulty of renewing UK passports during coronavirus, the Georgian authorities currently recognise as valid for residence and visa purposes, UK passports that have expired since 6 January 2020 or have less than six months’ validity when presented. These passports are considered to be expiring on 31 December 2021.</p> <p>This applies to the following passports - British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Protected Person, British Overseas Citizen and British Subject.</p> <p>This provision is founded on the UK Government recognising holders of such passports as British under international law, and will remain in place until 31 December 2021 unless the UK Government withdraws the recognition sooner.</p> <p>The extended expiry relates only to where you need a valid passport to reside in Georgia. It does not mean that your passport is valid as a travel document.</p> <p>If you are in Georgia, your passport has expired and you need a passport to travel elsewhere in the near future, you should apply for a new full validity UK passport. Please use this <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/overseas/information/georgia/renew/adult">guidance</a> to complete the application form and submit it at the Visa Application Centre in Tbilisi.</p> <p>If your passport has expired and you need to travel urgently you may be eligible for an Emergency Travel Document. Please follow the passport guidance linked above for more information.</p> <h2 id="regular-entry-requirements">Regular entry requirements</h2> <h3 id="visas">Visas</h3> <p>Prior to the current COVID-19 restrictions, British nationals did not need a visa to enter Georgia for visits of up to one year. If you wished to stay for longer, you would need to apply for a longer term visa category. Contact the <a rel="external" href="http://uk.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=42&amp;lang_id=ENG">Embassy of Georgia</a> in London or visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfa.gov.ge/Home.aspx?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=607&amp;month=11&amp;year=2011&amp;lang=en-US">Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a> for more details on entry requirements.</p> <h3 id="passport-validity">Passport validity</h3> <p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.</p> <h3 id="travel-insurance">Travel insurance</h3> <p>Make sure you have a valid travel insurance policy as you may be asked to provide evidence of this by your airline at check-in or by the immigration authorities upon arrival in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you cannot provide evidence of valid travel insurance.</p> <h3 id="travelling-with-medicines">Travelling with medicines</h3> <p>Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy, which can also cover prescription and non-prescription drugs or medicines, otherwise commonly available in the UK and the European Union. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal in Georgia. This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to administrative and criminal proceedings. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, please contact your nearest Embassy of Georgia.</p> <p>If you intend to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk//foreign-travel-advice/georgia/health">Health</a></p> <h3 id="uk-emergency-travel-documents">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3> <p>UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Georgia.</p>
